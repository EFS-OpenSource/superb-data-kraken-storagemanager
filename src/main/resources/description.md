The StorageManager service offers a JSON-based, RESTful API designed to manage storage contexts for organizations and spaces.

It serves as an interface to the underlying cloud storage system and manages the creation and removal of the storage context, which consists of all necessary
storage resources (like storage accounts or buckets) essential for spaces and organizations to provide storage capabilities.
